Goal:
Given two revision files (old and new), compare and compile the differences between the two: list all of the 
added, removed, and/or changed from and to the new revision. 

Notes: 
To create .exe file, delete all 'build' and 'dist' and '.spec' files, go to cmd and type "pyinstaller --onefile RevisionCompareToolVx.x.py"
For each update, remember to:
	Change the version number in banner, as well as the version number when writing file.


PATCH UPDATES:
Version 1.1: DO NOT USE - FLAW IN CODE (prints 'removed in next revision' twice).
Added date and time of the creation of the file; some format changes in the output.
When finished, .exe will remain open instead of instantly closing. 

Version 1.2:
Fixed typos, update "No changes in next revision" output
When finished, .exe will close after 5 seconds after printing if a new file has been created or not.
List is sorted by IPN, then REF, as opposed to the original REF then IPN.
Added Version number in the output.

Version 1.2.1: 
Fixed bugs: Printing changedInNext still prints when there is no items in changedInNext
.exe will close after 3 seconds after confirmation line.
