Goal:
Given a revision file and an OMRON file, compare the two inputs and output the changes there may be.

Notes: 
To create .exe file, delete all 'build' and 'dist' and '.spec' files, go to cmd and type "pyinstaller --onefile RevisionCompareToolVx.x.py"
For each update, remember to:
	Change the version number in banner, as well as the version number when writing file.


PATCH UPDATES:
Version 1.0:
Note: May handle certain 'duplicate' scenarios unexpectedly:
	Duplicates of REFs in the OMRON file may have differing IPNs (due to user input), and it will not detect an error.
	This scenario is caused by human error when inputting the IPNs to OMRON.

Version 1.01:
Fixed typo in the output, added file clarification in the .exe
