Revision Compare Tool:
Given two revision files (old and new), compare and compile the differences between the two: list all of the 
added, removed, and/or changed from and to the new revision.

Omron Verification Tool:
Given a revision file and an OMRON file, compare the two inputs and output the changes there may be. This is very similar to 
the RCT above.
